## Welcome to a Ruby on Rails sample_app project by the appwebtech! (Designer/developer; Joseph)

#### Development report (Errors, Issues & Omissions)

###### IMAGE ERROR UPLOAD IN C9
Encounterd issues in uploading images to C9 IDE. I had a similar issue with **Telerik** whilst converting hybrid apps for android and IOS, but it was spasmodic meaning that at times it would work and others not. Image extensions like *.jpegs had no issues in *Teleric*
'$ curl -OL'

Main problems resides with downloading and deploying images in the images pipeline folder. 
Tried different websites with unrestricted online sharing like wikipedia and managed to download an image but would'nt deploy it in the image pipeline. Some images wouldn't download at all in Bash like the case of rails logo from their server. See code below.

It's likely the issue might be solved as online coding evolves but until then, have to do all the work 
online using **version control** , then downlaod the whole project and upload images manualy using my home servers.
