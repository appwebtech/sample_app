## DEVELOPMENT REPORT
####ERRORS ISSUES AND OMISSIONS
###### IMAGE UPLOAD IN C9
**Encounters issues in uploading images to C9 IDE**
***$ curl -OL*** **Has issues with downloading and deploying images in the images pipeline folder**
**Tried different websites with unrestricted online sharing like wikipedia and same issue persists**
**It's likely the issue might be solved as online programming evolves but until then,** have to do all the work 
online and use **version control** on a private setting, then downlaod the whole project and do manual img updates.
